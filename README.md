# Social Robotics - Vocal Intent Recognition

Classification of audio signals based on their spectral features.
Two datasets are used and the algorithm has to classify 3 different voice patterns.
A Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the spectrograms of the different audio samples.

Accuracy and scalability results still need to be improved.
